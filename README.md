# finalproj-webdevfe

This is a final project that I submitted on 18 October 2018 to Galvanize's Front End course that ends 20 October.

The program works by pulling realtime data from the Bart API.
This program lets you track when the trains at a specified BART are departing.

In order to see this actually work, you'll have to download the code to your computer.
The github io page 

https://44thm0820.github.io/finalproj-webdevfe/

will not allow you to access the api directly as it pulls from an api that is a non https website.
You'll see the errors when you look at the console when you try to run it.
